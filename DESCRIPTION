Description: This pipeline employs a combination of curated collections of 
    known endogenous substrate sequences and data from phosphoproteomics-
    informed kinase assays to develop an in silico peptide library. This 
    library is used for systematic identification of position-specific 
    amino acid preferences. These preferences inform the design of artificial
    candidate sequences optimized for kinase-specific performance which can
    then be characterized in vitro or in vivo.
